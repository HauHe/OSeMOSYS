# Contributing to the OSeMOSYS documentation

We are very grateful that you are looking into how you can contribute to the
OSeMOSYS documentation.

Contributing to OSeMOSYS is open to everyone who is interested, and we adopt an
inclusive and open policy which is described in our
[code of conduct](../code_of_conduct.md)

The documentation consists of general installation and setup guides, an example
which considers the GNU MathProg implementation, and the formulation.

The model formulation consists of three levels

- an English language description
- the algebraic formulation
- and implementation specific documentation

You can help with the OSeMOSYS documentation by correcting spelling mistakes
and typos, cross-checking the different levels of the model formulation, or
updating and improving the installation, setup and tutorial guides.

To contribute your changes, please make your changes on a branch labelled
with the prefix `docs/` and submit a pull request when you are done.
