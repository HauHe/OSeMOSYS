## Git Workflow

To work with any of the OSeMOSYS code bases, please follow the forking workflow
recommended for contributing to open-source projects. The steps below assume
you have a Github account.

1. Fork the repository to which you wish to contribute by clicking the grey
   `fork` button or visiting https://github.com/osemosys/osemosys/fork
2. Clone your fork of the repository
   `git clone http://github.com/<user>/osemosys`
3. Create a new branch on which you will commit your changes
   `git checkout -b <branchname>`
4. Do the work and stage and commit your changes: `git add ...`,
   `git commit -m "A nice descriptive message"`
5. Push the changes to your fork `git push -u <branchname> origin/<branchname>`
6. Submit a pull request from your fork of the repository to the master branch
   of the original repository.
7. The pull request is reviewed. Any changes required by the review can be
   performed on the same branch and pushed to the forked repo as in the steps
   above.
8. Once the pull request has been reviewed and accepted,
   you may delete your local copy of the branch `git branch -d <branchname>` and
   update your copy of the master branch `git checkout master`,
   `git pull origin master`
